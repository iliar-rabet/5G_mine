This project optimizes the results of 
We employ an evolutionary optimization method (Simulated Annealing) for planning private 5G networks with the possibility of future expansion considering the terrain profile.
For the deployment, the framework may use permanent and temporary or mobile Base Stations (BSs). 
Permanent BSs are not expected to be deployed in locations that disturb mining operations, while temporary BSs are subject to fewer constraints since they can adapt to the dynamic terrain.
Our proposed optimization framework aims at improving connectivity and line-of-sight condition during the whole operation of the mine.

The block model of a mine and is solved to find the extraction sequence. Then a series of Digital Elevation Models are generated to be used with our optimization framework.
The process is illustrated below:
